Note on the relax_results_03.csv file: 

The RELAX analysis takes an alignment and a gene tree with a subset of labeled "test" branches 
(examples in "all_labeled" directory) and tests whether the "test" branches have experienced a 
significant relaxation or intensification of selection pressure. The p-value explains whether 
the test was significant and the K parameter signifies either intensification (K > 1) or 
relaxation (K < 1). 

The data from this file were simplified to only include significant results in the
*relaxed_intensified_genes.csv file used as input for the R script.
